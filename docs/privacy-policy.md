**_keys.band_** doesn't collect any personal data, doesn't track websites you visit, doesn't collect any form of usage analytics, doesn't sends any information to any service over the internet -- in fact, it doesn't even have a server anywhere, it's just an extension installed in your computer.

The only places **_keys.band_** sends information are to the Nostr relays you set when using Nostr.

**_keys.band_** stores only the information you explicitly set in the extension: account name and private keys. That information, however, is only stored in your own browser, using the local storage mode, not the synced storage mode that saves data to a browser-determined sync server. So if the guarantees offered by the browser itself hold true that information never leaves your browser.

For more information on the browser guarantees on which **_keys.band_** depends, please read Google Chrome's [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://ssl.gstatic.com/chrome/webstore/intl/en-US/gallery_tos.html).
